# AngBootRouter

This project was created for me to play with the --routing option in 
angular-cli.  I wanted to get module routing working.  I also wanted 
integrate bootstrap 4 in as well.  Finally, I wanted to authenticate 
with JWT approach.  The app goes against my [hero-service](https://github.com/wpfeiffe/hero-service) spring 
boot app both for Hero data and JWT login services.  I will continue
to add in angular functionality as a learning exercise.
